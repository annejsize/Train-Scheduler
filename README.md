## Overview
The Austin Train Scheduler is a web app, with the help of JQuery, Materialize, and Firebase, that features a live, up-to-date schedule for trains in the Austin area (we can hope one day this will actually happen!). The user is able to enter the time and frequency a train is set to run. The app will then calculate the run times for said train and post to the scheduler panel on the top.
